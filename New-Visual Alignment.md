Visual alignment, also known as the correspondence or registration problem.

optical flow, 3D matching, medical imageing, tracking and augmented reality.





Many works has been made on pairwise alignment (aligning images A to image B)

The problem of global joint alignment has not received as much attention.





Training on jointly aligned datasets can produce higher quality generative models than training on unaligned data.
